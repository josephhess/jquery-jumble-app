// when there is a guess it compares to solution word and
// updates the message.
// upon a new guess it clears out the message and runs through the
// process of checking if win etc.

// if a win, that is the message

// if not it checks that what guess the user is at
//   if at 4 it shows the definition
//     if at 5 it shows the you lose message with
//     solution word and definition

// also need to update the guess count each time.
